# Object Detection Model Project || Deployment Link: https://object-detect-model.netlify.app/

DESCRIPTION:
The Object Detection Model project showcases a web interface that uses an object detection model to identify and classify objects in real-time using the webcam. The model has been trained to recognize images of humans and mobile devices, providing instant feedback on detected objects.

FEATURES:
Real-time Object Detection: The web interface captures video from the user's webcam and processes it through the object detection model, delivering real-time results on detected objects.
User-Friendly Interface: The interface is designed for ease of use, with a simple "Start" button to initiate the webcam stream and the object detection process.
Label Display: Detected objects are labeled and displayed on the interface, accompanied by prediction probabilities.

HOW TO USE:
Access the Web Interface: Open the provided HTML file in a web browser.
Start Object Detection: Click the "Start" button on the interface to initiate the webcam stream and object detection process.
View Detected Objects: The detected objects will be labeled on the interface, along with prediction probabilities.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
HTML: The web interface is built using HTML for structuring the content.
CSS: CSS styles are applied to enhance the appearance and layout of the interface.
Machine Image Model: The core object detection model is integrated into the web interface using JavaScript.
TensorFlow.js: The TensorFlow.js library is utilized to load and run the Machine image model.

Thankyou!
